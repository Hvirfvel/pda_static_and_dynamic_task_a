### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:

  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1: # '=' should be '=='
      return True
    else
      return False
   

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2): # to be recognised as a function it needs to start with 'def'
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card # the if statement needs to return 'card1'
  else:
    return card2
  


def cards_total(self, cards): # the function needs to be indented
  total #total needs to get a value to be recognised as a variable
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total #return needs to be formatted
  
```
